I am a programmer, inventor and furniture maker.

I was CTO at <a href="https://decentraland.org">Decentraland</a> where I built engineering teams for many years. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://nu.bank">Nu Bank</a> helping international expansion teams and <a href="https://mulesoft.com">MuleSoft</a> building developer tools and programming languages, and worked at <a href="https://soflex.com.ar">Soflex</a> building the security systems that now drive most of Argentina's police, emergency and 911 dispatch systems.
